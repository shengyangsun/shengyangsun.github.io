## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, specializing in Information and Communication Engineering, with an expected graduation date in March 2025. I am passionate about research, and my interests lie in computer vision, video understanding, video anomaly detection, multimodal large language models, weakly supervised learning, deep learning, and machine learning.


## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** video understanding, video anomaly detection, multimodal fusion, multimodal large language model
- **Machine Learning:** unsupervised learning, weakly supervised learning, outlier detection

## News

- **[Feb. 2025]**  Our paper about Delving into Instance Modeling for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (**IF=8.3**).
- **[Sep. 2024]** We are thrilled to introduce our newly proposed **Textual-Guided Multimodal Video Anomaly Detection (TG-MVAD)** framework! In this work, we incorporate in-context learning to generate high-quality textual samples, resulting in a more adaptive text feature extractor tailored for anomaly detection. By utilizing this fine-tuned feature extractor, we significantly enhance the modelâ€™s detection capabilities while also improving the explainability of the detection results. This project is publicly available at [https://shengyangsun.github.io/TGMVAD](https://shengyangsun.github.io/TGMVAD), **[click here](https://shengyangsun.github.io/TGMVAD)**!
- **[Jul. 2024]** Our paper about Text-Driven Scene-Decoupled (TDSD) Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection has been accepted to ACM Multimedia (MM) 2024. 
- **[Jul. 2024]** Our paper about Event-Driven Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection has been accepted to Image and Vision Computing.
- **[May 2024]** We release the code of [Multi-scale Bottleneck Transformer (MSBT)](https://github.com/shengyangsun/MSBT), we encourage you to integrate the MSBT module into your framework to enhance the performance of feature fusion.
- **[Mar. 2024]** Our paper about MultiScale Bottleneck Transformer (MSBT) has been accepted to IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2024.
- **[Mar. 2023]** Our paper about Long-Short Temporal Co-Teaching (LSTC) for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection has been accepted to IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME) 2023.
- **[Feb. 2023]** Our paper about Hierarchical Semantic Contrast (HSC) for Scene-Aware Video Anomaly Detection has been accepted to IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2023.
