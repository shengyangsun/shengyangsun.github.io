## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, specializing in Information and Communication Engineering, with an expected graduation date in March 2025. I am passionate about research, and my interests lie in computer vision, video understanding, video anomaly detection, multimodal large language models, weakly supervised learning, deep learning, and machine learning.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** video understanding, video anomaly detection, multimodal fusion, multimodal large language model
- **Machine Learning:** unsupervised learning, weakly supervised learning

## News
